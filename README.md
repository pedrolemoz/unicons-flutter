## Installation

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  unicons: any
```

We recommend `flutter pub upgrade` to always stay updated with the latest release.

## Usage

The library exposes all of the [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) as `IconData`.
If you want to use [Line icons](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line), use `UniconsLine` class, but if you want to use [Solid icons](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/solid), use `UniconsSolid` instead.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unicons/unicons.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
      width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Icon(UniconsLine.camera),
          Icon(UniconsLine.baseball_ball),
          Icon(UniconsSolid.airplay),
          Icon(UniconsSolid.battery_empty),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
